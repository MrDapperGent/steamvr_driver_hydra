## Features

- IMU emulation can be toggled with BUTTON 1 on each controller, which enables the user to throw stuff. Since it causes a considerable amount of jitter, it is off by default.
- IMU emulation now also has angular velocity support. This means you can put a spin on objects. It can be toggled with BUTTON 2 when IMU emulation is active, and is enabled by default.
